# About

Coastal Views is an animated visualisation showing 'theoretical' sea views from the coastline of the United Kingdom. The app is written in JavaScript and built with v3.17 of the ArcGIS JavaScript API.


# Sample

# Configuring

You can animate your own views by creating a polyline feature service. You can update line 8 of main.js with your new service.
